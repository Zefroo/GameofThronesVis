## Game of Thrones Script Visualizations

This is a visualization project of Game of Thrones script data taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anderfj/game-of-thrones-series-scripts-breakdowns). This project involved cleaning up the original data-set, creating new sets of files with sentiment analysis on each line in the script as well as word counts, and creating a filed of nodes and edges to connected characters who shared scenes for a network analysis.
